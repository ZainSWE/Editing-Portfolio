        <h1>SHADOW | THE COLOR VIOLET</h1>
        <p>
          Sonic the Hedgehog 3 introduces Shadow, the mysterious and powerful rival to Sonic. Created as the “Ultimate Life Form,” Shadow is a darker, more serious character with a complex past tied to science experiments and loss. Unlike Sonic's upbeat energy, Shadow is calm, calculated, and driven by his own sense of purpose. His arrival shakes things up, bringing a new level of intensity and emotional depth to the story. The movie explores Shadow's origins, his internal conflict, and how he fits into a world that sees him as both a threat and a potential hero. His dynamic with Sonic is a central part of the film—clashing at first, but slowly revealing similarities between them. With high-stakes action, deeper themes, and a more serious tone, Shadow's presence gives Sonic 3 a dramatic edge. He isn't just a new rival—he's a major part of what makes this chapter stand out.

          Title: 𝗦𝗛𝗔𝗗𝗢𝗪 | 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗖𝗢𝗟𝗢𝗥 𝗩𝗜𝗢𝗟𝗘𝗧 [𝗘𝗗𝗜𝗧] <br><br>
          Growing up, I loved playing Sonic the Hedgehog games. Getting to see a Sonic trilogy is honestly something that I never would have seen coming back then. But the Sonic franchise proved to the Hollywood industry that video game movies shouldn't be slept on.
